      <description>Advanced Model Evaluation:&#xA;Implemented logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machine models for attrition prediction. Conducted rigorous model evaluation using ROC curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. Employed nested cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and ensure robust model performance. Interactive Shiny Dashboard:&#xA;Developed an interactive Shiny dashboard for visualizing predicted attrition in real-time. Integrated dynamic data tables allowing users to filter data by department and explore employees predicted to be in attrition group 1.</description>

      <description>Clustering Algorithms:&#xA;Implemented a variety of clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical clustering and KNN. Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct groupings, suggesting potential subgroups within the data Logistic Regression:&#xA;Conducted logistic regression analysis, exploring associations with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s group. Integrated eTIV into the final model, demonstrating good fit and predictive accuracy. Feature Selection using PCA:&#xA;Applied principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality. Retained 5 principal components, explaining 90% of the dataset&amp;rsquo;s variability.</description>
